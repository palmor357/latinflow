    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    COVID-19 is a complex pathological condition caused by infection with SARS-CoV. Different features have been observed in patients with a severe disease, one of these is the progressive increase of immune-mediated inflammation. Indeed, several reports have described abnormally increased levels of cytokines in plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, that has been defined “cytokine storm,” similarly to what described in bacterial sepsis or after CAR-T cell therapy. We have deeply investigated by flow cytometry the immune system and cells producing cytokines in patients affected by COVID-19 in 21 patients and 13 controls. Patients show an increased percentage of activated, exhausted T lymphocytes. B cell compartment showed even greater modifications, with decreased naïve and memory cells. Monocytes showed relevant signs of functional exhaustion, while neutrophils expressed more markers linked to degranulation. We found that in vitro stimulation caused a relevant production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL–2, as well as a significant skewing towards the Th17 phenotype.

    With the full spectrum technology onboard the Cytek® Aurora and Northern Lights, never before have we seen such high-sensitivity, high-parameter data from a fluorescence-based flow cytometer.  Over the past 3 years, Cytek Biosciences has been expanding possibilities in our current fluorochrome-limited world through internal R&amp;D, close collaboration with flow cytometry reagent companies, and through our growing community of users. Together, we have applied these new possibilities to meet today’s application needs.By exploring the full spectrum emitted from each fluorochrome, we have unlocked a more comprehensive and in-depth assessment of how these fluorochromes interact in a variety of applications; this knowledge has enabled our users to design experiments revealing biological populations that previously could not be easily resolved using fluorescence-based flow cytometry. We have also built a variety of tools that enable users to better evaluate compatibility and usability of fluorochromes together in a panel.Join us to learn more about how the Cytek® Aurora and Northern Lights measure the full spectrum emitted from each cell, allowing for expanded performance on an increasing number of applications.

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    The advent of active cellular therapy using TIL pre or after checkpoint inhibitor therapies represent viable treatment options for patients with solid cancers,  although TIL treatment of patients with  epithelial cancers provides – up to now – only  limited responses. We review four different layers of flow cytometric analysis platforms, i) release criteria for TIL, ii) explorative analysis of TILs using antigen recognition profiling and T-cell receptor (TCR) composition analysis, iii) the use of flow – cytometry guided analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and discuss iv) whether the use of cytokines, other than IL-2, e.g.  IL-7, may aid to expand TIL with differential recognition and homing patterns.

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    Given the magnitude and severity of the pandemic, people across diverse disciplines – in research, industry, and clinical laboratories – have shifted their focus to SARS-CoV2. Already, there are common questions emerging about how to plan for SARS-CoV2 research, including issues of biosafety, sample procurement, experimental design, and data analysis. A central aim is to have laboratories generate high quality, reproducible data with traceable, calibrated measurements. The ISAC COVID-19 Interest Group will assist in these areas, providing a centralized source for biosafety guidelines, a forum to discuss experimental design, a networking directory to establish collaborations, and a connection to data repositories and analysis algorithms. <br /><br />
The networking session will follow the main COVID-19 session and it will comprise a follow-on discussion of the cytometric challenges raised during the main session and explore opportunities for the cytometry community to respond effectively to the current pandemic. The discussion will be shaped by core members from the ISAC Community COVID-19 Interest Group - this group is open to all ISAC members and registered non-members with an interest in fighting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Attendees will have the opportunity to pose questions to the group and offer constructive contributions.

    Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV infection remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide necessitating novel and innovative interventions. The ability of the human immune system, in particular of T cells, to fight pathogens can be exploited for effective therapeutic strategies, including vaccines and new drugs. In this field, flow cytometry and advanced imaging can help to understanding the innate and adaptive immune responses both at the periphery and in the tissue microenvironment.<br />
Learning objectives:<br />
<ul>
<li>Describe how cytometry helps to fight tuberculosis</li>
<li>Describe and summarise the nature of human CD8+ T cell function in tissues</li>
<li>Identify novel imaging approaches to study organisation of immune cells in tissues</li></ul>

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    Human natural killer (NK) cells are critical immune effector cells that control viral infection and malignancy. Their importance is underscored by the severe disease that occurs when their development is impaired or dysregulated. Despite their importance, we have a poor understanding of the molecular events that drive their differentiation from common lymphoid progenitors. These events are thought to occur in tissue, including secondary lymphoid tissue, as a spectrum of developmental intermediates with increasingly restricted lineage potential that can be isolated from tissue and give rise to mature, functional NK cells. Here, we seek to define the spatial localization of NK cell developmental intermediates within human secondary lymphoid tissue to answer key questions about human NK cell development. Specifically, we aim to understand the spatial relationship between NK cell precursors and other immune cells and relevant cytoarchitecture using Imaging Mass Cytometry&trade;.  Our preliminary findings provide an exciting foundation for the first in situ ‘road map’ of human innate immune cell development in tissue.

 <h3> Special Plenary Session 2: CYTO Women Fireside Chat <span class="time"> 5:00pm - 6:30pm </span></h3>

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    CYTO Women was conceived by an engaged group of women at CYTO 2019 and seeks to address the involvement of women in ISAC, with encouragement and support, so that women from all constituencies play an active role on committees and programs, as well as in leadership positions within ISAC and across the field of cytometry. This inaugural session is a fireside chat where we discuss the challenges. Since the dawn of the modern women’s movement, women have trained and worked to achieve parity in the workplace.  Through all of the different phases and efforts, we have yet to achieve this and the trajectory for real progress continues at a slow pace.  The lack of equity in the workplace is often attributed to women needing to change how they are doing things, making us feel responsible.  Women are told to lean in to overcome barriers, but this is not sufficient and does not fix what is broken.  Something else is needed.  The problem is not the training of women. To address bias, we need to shift the focus from individuals to ways of imparting institutional change. Creating an inclusive workplace will require a focus on changing the conversation. This takes courage, commitment and compassion to embrace disruption and instigate systemic transformation.       
At the end of this session there will be a networking session.
