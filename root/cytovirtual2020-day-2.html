    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    Instrument manufacturers in the life science market are reporting a new trend. New reagents exposed with UV light are expanding the read capability of their instruments and enable new analysis capabilities of cells. This leads to a more commonly use of UV laser wavelengths in instruments e.g. flow cytometers. Coherent addresses the new trend with a novel platform of OBIS XT UV lasers for the instrumentation market. Further information is given on the specifications and performance of these lasers.  Given the nature of the wavelength and the current instrument designs new UV lasers for instrumentation must be disruptive compared with standard DPSS laser technology. The talk reviews how the OBIS XT addresses the design demands from instrument manufacturers and how the integration into instruments like flow cytometers is simplified. The talk will end with recommendations on the integration of UV lasers in general and will end with an outlook into future UV products.

 <h3> Unraveling Deep Receptor Profiles using High Dimensional Tool Sets - BD Biosciences <span class="time"> 10:30am - 11:30am </span></h3>
 <div class="session-info">

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    Over the last several decades the scientific community has greatly advanced our understanding of the immune system identifying hundreds of unique CD markers, cytokine and chemokine receptors as well as thousands of genes to characterize and isolate cellular subsets to better understand their function and role in the human condition. Simultaneously, technological advancements have provided researchers the ability to multiplex high numbers of these analytes at the single-cell level, increasing the size and velocity of data sets. Despite the increase in fluorescent channels available on high-parameter flow cytometers, the field still is hampered from being able to use large numbers of specificities. Recently with the introduction of antibody sequencing applications, the scaling of proteomics has now been initiated.Today we will highlight contributions from the scientific community paired with advances in BD high-parameter technology to simplify and streamline customer workflows including:<br />
<ul> 
<li>Complementarity of the high-dimensional BD FACSymphony&trade;A5 Cell Analyzer and BD FACSymphony&trade; S6 Cell Sorter platforms.</li>
<li>Single-cell genomics via the BD Rhapsody&trade; Single-Cell Analysis System and BD® AbSeq Assay.</li>
<li>Panel design and data analysis tools and datasets.</li></ul>

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to study complex and heterogeneous cell populations, while platforms such as the BD Rhapsody&trade; Single-Cell Analysis System allow researchers to profile tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. In addition to whole transcriptome and targeted mRNA profiling, recent advances such as BD® AbSeq Oligonucleotide-Conjugated Antibodies allow researchers to examine 100+ proteins alongside RNA in the same assay. With the release of BCR/TCR receptor profiling, the BD Rhapsody can now analyze an even wider repertoire of molecules from the same cell. Here we showcase multiomics approaches to identifying and studying  cell populations, pairing gene expression, protein expression and immune-repertoire information from the same cells in a single assay. Together these solutions can be harnessed to answer complex and important biological questions. <br /><br /><em>BD, the BD Logo and Rhapsody are trademarks of Becton, Dickinson and Company or its affiliates. &copy; 2020 BD.

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    As the number of dimensions being interrogated rises, thorough identification and characterization of populations using traditional manual gating analysis becomes more challenging. Manual gating requires subjective selection of features and declaration of population membership using 1 or 2 dimensional plots, an approach that not only requires previous knowledge of the phenotypic expression patterns of populations being identified, but also invariably applies operator bias when creating and drawing gates. Computational methods for clustering attempt to overcome these limitations by classifying events into populations defined by all dimensions simultaneously as a region of local density within marker space, acting more objectively, and potentially identifying novel populations that would be ignored or missed with manual gating. But how to get started employing such methods? Which clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms are the best ones to use? How do you compare many samples, identify cluster phenotypes and visualize the populations resulting from a clustering algorithm? And perhaps most important, how can you sort an algorithm-derived population for downstream functional and single cell multi-omics studies? Join us as we address these questions and discuss how to employ the newest suite of tools in FlowJo, which enable computational discovery and sorting.

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    Fluorescence is the critical infrastructure on which our experiments, from imaging to flow cytometry and sorting, travel.  Traditional dyes and the consequent hardware response are holding us back from easier experimental design, data analysis, high purity sorting, and multi-omic measurement. In this tutorial, we will describe our progress in massively expanding the number of questions per cell in flow cytometry leveraging our labels -- the largest set of new fluorophores than have been released in the past 20 years.  Additionally, we will describe fluorescence for biology, and how to design fluorescent labels with specific, controllable requirements for excitation, emission, and brightness.   We will show our work in producing conjugated antibodies and pushing the envelope across all instruments - from clean experiments on 12 detector instruments to well beyond 40 colors.  We also share our customers’ success stories and share why one customer described our products as “The best addition to flow cytometry in the last 10 years.”We will also take on and reveal solutions to several elephant-in-the-room problems in our field: (1) the stability and performance of tandem dyes, (2) the heuristics of panel design, (3) the divide between genomic and flow cytometry, (4) lot to lot inconsistency, and (5) innovation in critical infrastructure.

    The session focuses on the small but in wider contexts. From a background of research on the co-evolution of microbe and virus (phage) in environmental populations, as well as the impact of marine phages on microbe-mediated biogeochemistry, global sampling approaches are revealing are revealing  new aspects of oceanic ecosystems. The session features studies on extracellular vesicles (EVs) - the secretion of which from cells promotes aggressive, invasive behavior and facilitates tumor growth and metastasis, while simultaneously presenting a challenge for both their characterisation and exploitation by cytometry.
