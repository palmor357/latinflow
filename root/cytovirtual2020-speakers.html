      <p class="speaker-title"></p><strong>Thomas Ashhurst, PhD</strong>, High-Dimensional Cytometry Specialist, Sydney Cytometry Core Facility and Discipline of Pathology; ISAC Marylou Ingram Scholar<p></p>
      <p class="speaker-bio">Dr. Ashhurst's research is focused on analysing cellular infiltration in the virally infected CNS, and understanding how the haematopoietic system is reorganised in the bone marrow to change cellular output in response to infection. To do this, his team utilises high-dimensional cytometry systems (such as mass cytometry and 29-parameter next generation fluorescence cytometry) to interrogate cellular systems in a range of disease contexts. To aid their analysis, they apply and improve existing computational analysis tools, in addition to developing their own novel algorithms for analysing high dimensional datasets.  Dr. Ashhurst and his team are always eager for new collaborations on multiple fronts.</p>

      <p class="speaker-bio">Dr. Michael Betts received his PhD in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of North Carolina in 1998, studying CD8+ T cell responses in HIV elite controllers.  He completed his postdoctoral training with Dr. Richard Koup at the NIH Vaccine Research Center in 2005, where he continued to define HIV-specific T cell responses through the development and implementation of novel flow-cytometry based assays. He started his lab at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Microbiology in 2005, rising to the rank of Professor in 2019. The goal of his scientific research is to gain an understanding of the nature of T cell immune responses to pathogens and auto-antigens in humans. Towards this end, his lab has developed and adapted many immunological assays for the study of viral-specific immune responses in humans, including intracellular cytokine staining, CTL epitope mapping, CD8+ T cells degranulation measurement, and polyfunctional flow cytometry that are broadly used by the global human immunology research community. Since 2012 the lab has transitioned to the study of human and nonhuman primate lymphoid tissues and fluids, including various regional lymph nodes, spleen, thoracic duct lymph fluid, and oral lymphoid tissues in the context of HIV infection, vaccination, diabetes, and multi-centric Castleman’s disease. </p>

      <p class="speaker-bio">Vivian Gamas' laboratory is interested in understanding the dynamic properties of the mitochondria in the context of neural development and tumorigenesis. I will discuss the approaches we are using to characterize the status of the mitochondrial network during development and tumorigenesis. Our experimental paradigm includes classical biochemical and cellular approaches as well as state of the art imaging techniques and human brain organoids derived from patients' cells to integrate information at the single-cell level into the overall complexity of the brain environment. Our overall goal is to understand the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial dynamics/function in brain development, and to reveal how this heterogeneity may underlie differences in the response of brain tumor cells to therapy.

      <p class="speaker-bio">Matthew B. Sullivan studies viruses that infect microbes in their natural settings. The ‘microbiome’ is increasingly recognized to drive Earth’s ecosystems, including in humans, but it does so under constraints imposed by viruses. Sullivan pioneered viral ecogenomics as a means to study viruses in complex communities via quantitative viral metagenomic sample-to-sequence pipelines, new approaches to link viruses and hosts, and developing iVirus, a community-available analytical platform. In the oceans, Sullivan has vastly expanded our understanding of the global virosphere, established automatable scalable taxonomic approaches, and elucidated how ‘wild’ viruses evolve and even metabolically reprogram the most abundant photosystems on the planet. Outside the oceans, Sullivan has adapted these toolkits for use in extreme environments, soils and humans with each new environment leading to myriad discoveries that place viruses at the core of these microbial ecosystems.</p>
