<h3> Amnis® ImageStream®X Mk II High Gain Mode for Increased Small Particle Detection and EV Analysis on the Amnis® CellStream® Using the vFC&trade; Assay from Cellarcus Biosciences, Inc. - Luminex Corporation </h3>
 <div class="session-info">
    <a href="https://learning.isac-net.org/products/amnis-imagestreamx-mk-ii-high-gain-mode-for-increased-small-particle-detection-and-ev-analysis-on-the-amnis-cellstream-using-the-vfc-assay-from-cellarcus-biosciences-inc-luminex-corporation" class="btn btn-primary" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">View Session</a>
    <h5>Overview</h5>   
    <hr />
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-derived structures that include exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. In recent years, the importance of EVs has become apparent, as they are key mediators of intercellular communication. However, quantifying and characterizing EVs in a reproducible and reliable manner is challenging due to their small size&mdash;exosomes range from 30 to 100 nm in diameter. In this tutorial, we first describe the use of High Gain mode on the Amnis® ImageStream®X Mk II Imaging Flow Cytometer to address the challenges of measuring small particles. In this new High Gain mode, the charge-coupled device (CCD)-camera is adjusted to higher gain settings, increasing the signal obtained from the EV. Object thresholds and masking have also been adjusted to better identify and detect small particles. Preliminary results using murine leukemia virus-sfGFP reference particles have shown up to a 5-fold increase in the number of GFP-positive objects collected in High Gain mode when compared to standard gain on the ImageStream® System. In this study, we demonstrate improved small particle detection, including EVs, using this new High Gain mode. The second part of this tutorial describes the use of a quantitative and specific Vesicle Flow Cytometry assay (vFCTM, Cellarcus Biosciences, Inc.) that takes advantage of the high sensitivity of the Amnis® CellStream® Flow Cytometer. The vFCTM assay consists of a full suite of reagents needed to analyze EVs, including stains, calibrators, and standards, as well as detailed sample preparation and analysis protocols. This assay ensures quantitative and reproducible results. Additionally, we describe the measurement of EV numbers, size, and surface cargo, including tetraspanin and cell-specific markers using the Amnis® CellStream®.

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    The ImageStream® Mk II and FlowSight® imaging flow cytometers deliver objective, quantitative, and statistically significant high-content data. The richness of the image data and the associated features in the IDEAS® Software (SW) provides huge benefits for researchers, but also introduces complexity in data analysis. We address this issue by providing a new software package that leverages image data with sophisticated, deep learning algorithms to provide solutions to complex problems. The SW provides tools for model training with AI-assisted tagging to facilitate the generation of training data sets. It also creates new AI classifiers that can then be used to classify populations of cells in subsequent data sets. With a database architecture optimized to handle large data sets, an interactive image gallery, and comprehensive report generation, the SW provides an intuitive experience for users, enabling a streamlined data analysis workflow. In this workshop, Dr. Vidya Venkatachalam will explain the features of Amnis AI software&mdash;including how it simplifies high dimensional image data analysis&mdash;and demonstrate its use on cell data that is difficult to analyze using traditional methods.

 <h3> Functional Cell Sorting: Automated Imaging, Sorting, and Isolation of Single Cells, Clonal Colonies, and Organoids - Cell Microsystems, Inc. </h3>
 <div class="session-info">
    <a href="https://learning.isac-net.org/products/cell-microsystems-inc-commercial-tutorial" class="btn btn-primary" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">View Session</a>
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    Contemporary single cell biology experiments typically rely on isolating single cells by flow cytometry, encapsulation in a droplet, or micro-manipulation. These methods limit the ability to maintain viability, actively select individual cells of interest, and discern more meaningful information from each cell. The CellRaft AIR&trade; System addresses these limitations and enables streamlined workflows in CRISPR gene editing, stem cell biology, 3D cell culture, and single cell multi-modal analysis. The AIR System is a bench-top instrument capable of imaging, sorting, and isolating single cells or clonal colonies for downstream molecular analysis. The system is based on the CellRaft technology and employs CytoSort Arrays - a proprietary cell culture dish designed with an array of embedded, releasable microwells - to culture, propagate, and phenotype cells prior to isolation. These consumable arrays closely replicate standard in vitro conditions, rendering the array an ideal substrate for time-course phenotyping, drug sensitivity assays, and other imaging-based evaluation prior to isolation for expansion or analysis. The system has been shown to be effective in verifying clonality and ensuring doublets/dead cells aren’t carried downstream. For 3D cell culture applications, growth of organoids in Matrigel and subsequent isolation after weeks of culture has been demonstrated on the system. Workflows in cell line development, antibody discovery, and iPSC reprogramming and differentiation are all well-suited to this approach. In this talk, we will introduce the CellRaft technology, discuss how it compares to traditional methods, and show example data for several applications.

<h3> Consideration in High Dimension Flow Cytometry Data Analysis – Tercen </h3>
 <div class="session-info">
    <a href="https://learning.isac-net.org/products/consideration-in-high-dimension-flow-cytometry-data-analysis-tercen" class="btn btn-primary" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">View Session</a>
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <hr />
    Flow cytometry is a widely applied approach to exploratory immune profiling and biomarker discovery in healthy or pathological conditions. Flow cytometry uses antibodies tagged with fluorochromes or fluorescent dyes for which novel methods allow up to 50 detection parameters. More recently, an innovative technology using stable metal isotopes instead of fluorochromes has emerged. Mass and spectral cytometry has enabled high dimensional analysis and resulted in new research opportunities and challenges.  Scientists can no longer manage with the classical bi-axial gating strategy and they need new algorithms, statistical knowledge, terminology, and tools to develop standard analysis approaches. Tercen tutorial material demonstrates how to use workflows, dimension reduction (e.g. PCA, tSNE, UMAP), clustering (e.g. FlowSOM), and marker metrics (e.g. MEM scores). In addition, Tercen gives users the opportunity to integrate different types of data to high dimensional flow cytometry and boost biomarker discovery. Watch our tutorial and join us on Tercen to learn more about High dimensional Flow Cytometry.
